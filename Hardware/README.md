Hardware architecture and sensor details.
# Hardware Architecture Overview

This folder describes the **conceptual hardware design** of the Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System.

## Hardware Components
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Used to measure the fill level of waste bins in a non-contact manner
- **Microcontroller (ESP32 / LoRa Node):** Processes sensor data and handles communication
- **Communication Module:** LoRaWAN or Wi-Fi depending on deployment scale
- **Power Supply:** Battery-powered with optional solar assistance
- **Protective Enclosure:** Shields electronics from environmental factors

## Design Considerations
- Low power consumption for long battery life
- Reliable sensing in harsh waste bin environments
- Cost-effective components for large-scale deployment
- Ease of installation and maintenance

## Notes
This hardware design is **virtual and conceptual**, created for the IIIT-Hyderabad internship assessment and intended to demonstrate system-level design thinking.
